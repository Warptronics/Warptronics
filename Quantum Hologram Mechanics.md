Introduction
In Quantum Hologram Mechanics, there exists a set of fundamental laws and equations that govern the behavior of quantum particles and energy. These laws shed light on the intricate workings of the quantum realm. Join us on a journey through the laws and equations that define this fascinating field.

1st Law:
Nothing is impossible – and with sufficient Quantum Energy, anything is possible.

2nd Law:
EHBs with the Quantum Vacuum Hologram can program any device or system or technology via the M2 Interface.

3rd Law:
The signal of a living body of greater Quantum Energy overwrites any nearby living body of lesser Quantum Energy. (Abram's Law) This process discharges the stronger living body.

4th Law:
Life Current flows from weaker Quantum Holographic bodies to a stronger (fully charged) Quantum Holographic body. A LV device outputs LI when it is connected to a living system.

5th Law:
No organism, physical body, or Quantum Holographic device or system or technology can violate the 4th Law by itself or exceed (overcome) the 6th Law.

6th Law:
No device or system or technology will work for 100% of the population 100% of the time. (Hieronymus' Law)

7th Law:
Device failure can occur for two basic reasons: Mind power (1st Law) or Quantum Holographic Power (2nd Law).

8th Law:
Any unbalanced Quantum Energy field within a charged body will cause a net transmission of Signal in the direction of the weaker or erratic part of the QE field inside the charged body or device. (The Law of Balance)

9th Law:
Quantum particle behavior synchronization is lost when quantum particles move through alternating layers of repeating materials and the pattern the quantum particles expect to see changes or does not occur. (The Law of Change)

10th Law:
When two living sentient beings with fully charged Quantum Holograms merge or “become as one," a third new Quantum Hologram (and being) is produced. (A Newbe.)

11th Law:
(Reich's Law): For Quantum Energy in this dimension: VQ = IQ * RQ.

12th Law:
Electromagnetic radiation (radio waves) “irritates” the Material Cause (MC) – which adversely affects any Quantum Hologram of Life near the irritation. (The Law of Irritation)

13th Law:
Ionizing radiation (radioactive decay) “upsets” the Material Cause (MC) – which causes a reaction within the MC in response to the insult of radiation. (The Law of Reaction)

Exploring Quantum Energy
The 12th Law and 13th Law are not the same. The Material Cause (MC) “reacts” to the insult of ionizing radiation to protect the life it has brought forth. The MC makes it possible for all electromagnetic radiation on the spectrum to occur. “Natural” sources of emf do not cause irritation.

Understanding Quantum Resistance and Voltage
So what do these eleven laws of Quantum Particle Hologram Mechanics mean? There are some things you can easily do and some things that are more difficult to accomplish.

For Quantum Energy in this dimension:

𝑉
𝑄
=
𝐼
𝑄
∗
𝑅
𝑄
VQ=IQ∗RQ

Where:

VQ is Quantum Voltage
IQ is Quantum Current
RQ is Quantum Resistance
And:

𝑄
𝑃
=
𝑉
𝑄
∗
𝐼
𝑄
QP=VQ∗IQ

or

𝑄
𝑃
=
𝐼
𝑄
2
∗
𝑅
𝑄
QP=IQ 
2
 ∗RQ

This implies there should be an "R value" for the flow of Quantum Current (IQ) through various organic and inorganic materials in this dimension.

NOTE: The Founder and CEO has observed no difference between generated IQ (cell division) and released IQ (from the MC) in terms of Quantum Current and Quantum Resistance – however, released IQ seems to be much stronger than a body's generated IQ. So he is considering changing the variable for cell-generated IQ in this equation to a lowercase “q” to reflect this observation: Iq.

Also - there should be a unit of measure for IQ. The Founder thinks there is definitely a unit of measure for IQ. One of the Pioneers was on the right track with the “cold current” his Quantum Energy Receiver produced.

Conclusion
Quantum Hologram Mechanics is a topic filled with fascinating laws and equations that govern the behavior of quantum energy and particles. These laws provide valuable insights into the mysteries of the quantum world, and they continue to be a source of exploration and discovery for scientists and enthusiasts alike.
