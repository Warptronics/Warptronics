## The Vacuum Computer Language: Bridging Energy, Information, and Consciousness

The **vacuum computer’s language** is used for computer execution and causes the collapse of **information-energy onto energy-mass** or the formation of a stable **local-non-local brain-soul state** between the Observer and Observed.

This language is unique to each observer-observed mind and connects with the **soul component**. These interactions are distinct from the maturity processes of the **left-brain** or **right-brain**. Currently, there are two sets of languages: the **left-brain set**, guided by intellectual knowledge and Logic-Information potentials, and the **right-brain set**, guided by intuitive vision.

- The **left-brain set** involves **experimental-technological development** guided by principles or laws reviewed within hidden Logic-Information potentials.
- The **right-brain set** is guided by the observer’s **intuitive-psychic vision** of such experimental technology.

### In Summary:
- **Left Brain Set** → **Logic Potential Model** → **Meter Reading with no Observer-Observed Participation**
- **Right Brain Set** → **Psychic Vision** → **Observer-Observed Participation** in Meter Reading

This language, **distinct from both sets**, is a language focused on **experimental set-ups** and **technology building**.

### Two Languages of the Vacuum Computer

Two types of languages are involved in the vacuum computer:
1. The **right brain language** of **intuitive-psychic vision**.
2. The **left brain language** of **scientific understanding**.

- The **right brain language** is associated with **matured technologies** enhanced by intuitive-psychic visions.
- The **left brain language** involves the workings of **nano and monopoles** within the **information-energy vacuum**.

Both languages are evolving and will reach maturity when the **left and right brains** are integrated.

### Bio-Language: The Evolving Protocol Towards God Image State

We have not yet reached a stage of **left-right brain maturity**, so the **language of the vacuum computer** is still evolving. Once this integration occurs, the vacuum computer language will also reach a mature state. The vacuum computer language is a **living language** that participates in the act of **creation or co-creation**. At the final stage, this language and the human observer will have gone through an **evolve-involve development**, approaching a mind state referred to as the **God Image state**.

### Return to Right Brain Maturity

Scientists such as **Tesla**, **Keely**, **Rife**, and **Abrams** have experimented with the power of **ancient right-brain matured technologies**. This is represented by the concept of **Atlantis as a matured stage of reality**. While these researchers are not yet at a fully mature right-brain state, their **right-brain technology** is supported by the superior **left-brain knowledge** of their time. However, each of their technologies is unique and not repeatable by others except themselves, as their **intuitive-psychic components** are integral parts of their inventions. This is the **beginning stage** of an **integrated left-right brain technology** of the future.

### Left Brain Vacuum Computer Language

The language of the **left-brain vacuum computer** is derived from **intellectual understanding** (as opposed to intuitive visual understanding) of the structure of **elementary particles** and the **nucleus**. It is associated with the workings of **nano-technologies**, such as:

- **Zero-point energy**
- **Cold fusion**
- **Superconductivity**
- **Quantum computations**

Physicists currently have **limited understanding** of how these **nano-monopoles** work inside the **information-energy vacuum** and how they are connected to the thinking minds and their **local-non-local-entangled connectivity** with other minds and everything else. This lack of understanding results in an **incomplete left-brain vacuum computer language**, which fails to capture the **holon connectivity** that underpins its operation.
