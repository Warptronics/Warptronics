# Scalar Potentials and Scalar Waves

Due to the large amount of misinformation regarding the subject of scalar waves, we have included this section to help raise awareness of the differences between accepted scalar scientific ideas and pseudo-scientific theories.

In the previous sections, we discussed the difference between scalar and vector quantities and how this relates to electromagnetic waves. This section covers ‘Scalar Waves’ and ‘Scalar Field Theory’ to remove some of the mystery and confusion around these subjects.

If you enter the search term “Scalar Waves" into a popular search engine, you will find many pages discussing the topic of ‘Scalar Electromagnetic Waves’. This is misleading, as such waves are unproven in the accepted scientific community.

## Scalar Fields in Physics

In mathematics and physics, a scalar field associates a scalar to every point in space. Scalar fields are often used in physics, for example, to indicate the temperature distribution throughout space or the air pressure. Some waves, such as temperature waves or pressure waves, can be considered scalar waves because temperature and pressure are scalar quantities—they have no direction associated with them.

However, **electromagnetic phenomena** always have a directional (vector) component because magnetic fields are always dipoles (north and south poles), caused by the motion of charged particles or an electric current.

## The Problem with 'Scalar Electromagnetic Waves'

Below is an excerpt from Wikipedia about scalar electromagnetic waves. The theory is widely regarded as pseudoscience, yet is often promoted in discussions about 'free energy' or 'over unity'. The article contains many flaws and mathematical errors, so proceed with caution.

> Scalar wave theory is controversial and considered pseudoscience by most qualified scientists. Although the concept of scalar waves is promoted by some researchers, it lacks scientific validity within the established physics community.
>
> Scalar fields, as defined academically, associate scalar values (e.g., temperature, pressure) to points in space but have no direction. Electromagnetic waves, however, involve both electric and magnetic fields, which are vector quantities and inherently directional.

## Magnetic Fields and Scalar Energy

SFT (Scalar Field Theory) proposes interactions between magnetic fields and scalar potentials, although these ideas remain unproven.

### Interaction of Magnetic Fields
- When magnetic fields oppose each other, the magnets pull together.
- When aligned, magnets push apart, creating what some call a "scalar bubble."
- The greater the repulsion, the larger the scalar bubble, which shrinks as the force decreases.

Similarly, two magnets strongly attracted to one another create a "scalar void" between them. This effect, however, remains speculative without empirical backing.

### Skepticism and Rejection

Despite the enthusiasm of its proponents, scalar field theory lacks reproducible experimental results. Classical electromagnetism and quantum electrodynamics have consistently shown spectacular agreement with theoretical predictions, which undermines scalar field theory.

## Field Effects of Scalar Energy

Scalar energy has been proposed to interact with space like an electromagnetic wave but with different principles. The regular expansion and contraction of a scalar bubble, similar to ripples in water, is said to perturb scalar voids elsewhere.

Although some researchers claim scalar energy can affect distant objects, these effects remain controversial and unverified in the mainstream scientific community.

## Scalar Communication Systems

A theoretical scalar communication system attempts to exploit magnetic field repulsion/attraction to create scalar bubbles. However, these systems contradict standard electromagnetic theory, and real-world tests have failed to provide reproducible results.

## Conclusion

Scalar wave theory continues to captivate certain fringe communities, but it remains **pseudoscientific** in the eyes of the established scientific community. While we present this information to give you insight into the claims surrounding scalar waves, we encourage a critical approach and a reliance on proven science.

We are not trying to prove or disprove scalar theory, only to provide unbiased information. If you can contribute to improving this section, please [contact us](#).

### Info from Wikipedia:

Scalar field theory posits a form of electromagnetic energy more basic than electric and magnetic fields. Proponents claim it as an incomplete aspect of standard electromagnetic theory. Skeptics call it pseudoscience, pointing out that it lacks empirical support.

Scalar waves are hypothetical waves that differ from conventional electromagnetic transverse waves by having a longitudinal oscillation component. This, however, remains unproven.
